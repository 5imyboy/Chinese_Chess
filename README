CHINESE CHESS

TO RUN:
run python3 on main.py to run the program.
Some ways of doing this are
- opening main.py on some API (like visual studio code) or
- navigating to main.py on the terminal or shell, and typing "python3 <path-to-file>/main.py"
Note that the game uses pygame to function.
Thus, pygame must be installed on your machine for the game to work.
To install pygame, type "pip3 install pygame" into the terminal or shell.


TO MOVE:
When it is your turn
- click on the piece you want to move. The piece will move with your mouse
- drag the piece to where you want to move it to, and click again
- to cancel a move, move the piece to its original spot and click
- move already made cannot be cancelled
